Validating means to checking the code.  

Why validate? ----> Browsers are programmed to fix your errors. But not all browsers fix them in the same way. As the pages become more complex "hidden" areas can be very devastating. 
		    Our site should be consitent no matter where we are opening the site. 

How ? --> Three approaches 1. Validate by URL, 2. Vaidate By Filename, 3. Validate by Direct Input
     -->  We use vaidator.w3.org to validate the code. it will find the errors that break the rules of the DOM structurre.
